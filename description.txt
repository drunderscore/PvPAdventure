[c/FFFF00:Terraria PvP Adventure]
A competitive PvP community game mode that brings the full Terraria experience into fast, high-stakes matches.

Started in 2020, TPVPA is built around 3-hour long, bi-weekly games with 12–18 players. 
Earn points by taking down bosses, or hunt other players and steal their points. 
We keep things as vanilla as we can—but that simple idea has grown into 5+ years of active development.

- A working scoreboard built for competitive play
- Anti-snowball mechanics to keep games close
- Per-weapon PvP damage falloff + balancing
- PvP and PvE hitsounds + killsounds
- Endgame armor reworks for PvP
- Beetle Scale Mail levels up from kills
- Spectre armor team-heals from PvP damage
And more

At the highest level, TPVPA plays like an e-sport: 
live-casted invitational matches featuring some of the best Terraria 
players in the world—speedrun record holders and veterans with years of PvP experience.
